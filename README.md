## Introduction

This guide is intended to help you get started with the coworking streams! Whether you're a new or existing coworking streamer, we hope you find this guide useful.

I am a coworking streamer myself and I also made several open source widgets for the coworking streams. 

Please feel free to drop by my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/RythonDev" target="_blank">stream</a>!

## How I made this website

### Frameworks and Tools

- Astro (https://astro.build)

    Astro is a static site generator that supports server-side rendering. It supports Markdown which I used for most of the content on this website.

- Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com)

    Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. It's very easy to use and it's very powerful. I used it to style this website on top of Astro, including the Markdown content!

- Markdown (https://www.markdownguide.org)

    Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. I used Markdown to write most of the content on this website.

### Deployment

This website is deployed on <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, which is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. It automatically updates the website whenever I push changes to the GitHub repository.

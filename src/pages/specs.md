# Specifications

In this section, we will discuss the minimum computer specification requirements for coworking streams. The minimum specifications should be suffice for a comfortable streaming and viewing experience.

Note: Some smaller study streamers use their smartphones to stream. This is a great option for those who are just starting out, but it is not recommended for long-term streaming, due to limited settings and limited interactivity with viewers.

<details>
<summary>CPU</summary>

The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of the computer. The better the CPU, the faster the computer can process data and instructions.

**The ideal CPU for streaming**: A quad-core processor, preferably with a clock speed of 3.0 GHz or higher, such as an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5.

<details>
<summary>GPU (optional)</summary>

The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is the component that renders images on the screen. The better the GPU, the better the image quality and the higher the frame rate. A dedicated GPU is not required for streaming, but it is recommended for a better viewing experience.

**The ideal GPU for streaming**: A dedicated graphics card with at least 4GB of VRAM, such as an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 or AMD Radeon RX 560.

<details>
<summary>RAM</summary>

RAM (Random Access Memory) is the component that stores data and instructions for the CPU to process. The more RAM a computer has, the better it is at multitasking.

**The ideal RAM for streaming**: At least 8GB of RAM, preferably 16GB or more.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Storage</summary>

Storage is the component that stores data and instructions for the CPU to process. The more storage a computer has, the more data and instructions it can store at once.

**The ideal storage for streaming**: At least 256GB of SSD storage, preferably 512GB or more.

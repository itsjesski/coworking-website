# Introduction

A brief introduction to coworking streams! Let's keep each other accountable ^^

## What are coworking streams?

> Coworking (or study) streaming is an opportunity to share a virtual, productive, space with others and to connect based on interests and studies - in some ways replicating the in-person office, library, or cafe. Often, study streaming follows a pomodoro counter so that streamers can focus on working for a set amount of time and then converse with chat during another set amount of time for break.

Many viewers like to watch coworking streams because it provides motivation and accountability, which is especially hard if you're trying to focus at home. In the light of Covid, where working from home is becoming more common, it can nice to find an environment with like-minded people. Plus, the sense of community attracts many people - often coworking streams are very welcoming and supportive!

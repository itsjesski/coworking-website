				What are Coworking & Study streams?
			</h2>
			<p class="w-4/5 lg:w-1/2">
				Coworking and study streams are a type of stream where
				people work or study together. It's a great way to stay
				motivated and productive, especially if you're working!

				Why did you and other people make these resources open
				source?
			</h2>
			<p class="w-4/5 lg:w-1/2">
				Personally, I'm a huge fan of open source software, and I
				believe that open source is the future. I want to contribute
				to the open source community, and I hope that these overlays
				will help you get started with your own coworking or study
				stream!

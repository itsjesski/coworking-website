## How to Separate your Audio for meetings/classes

### Easy way (have two different outputs)

<img src="/images/music-and-audio/audio_settings.webp" alt="Audio settings" loading="lazy" />

To do this, you'll need to have two different audio outputs (i.e. two headphones/speakers). For windows users, go to sound settings --> advance sound options --> app volume device preferences (or if you can't find it, search "sound mixer options" in your start) then you should see this:

There you can have your different outputs for different programmes. For example, one pair of headphones is used for zoom, and the other for everything else. In your streaming software, make sure the output is selected for the correct pair of headphones in your mixer!

### Complicated ways

- #### [VoicemeeterBanana](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm) (Windows only!)

  - Download Voicemeeter Banana (software to route audio sources) and set all the audio sources/inputs you don't want to include on stream into a Voicemeeter input/output source separate from the main routing. 
  - The outputs will show up separately in your Audio Mixer, which you can adjust/mute

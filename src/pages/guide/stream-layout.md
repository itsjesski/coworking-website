## Principles of Grouping

The principles of grouping explain how our brains see patterns. We naturally group things that are close together, look similar, or are connected. This helps us make sense of the visual world around us.

There are five main principles of grouping:

- **Proximity**: Objects close together are perceived as being related. Imagine scattered stars. We tend to see groups or constellations based on closeness, even if the stars aren't truly connected.

- **Similarity**: Objects that look similar are seen as belonging together. A row of red balls amongst yellow ones will likely be perceived as a separate group.

- **Continuity**: Elements arranged along a line or curve are perceived as following a path and being related. Think of stepping stones leading across a stream.

- **Closure**: We tend to fill in gaps to create a complete whole.  A broken circle can still be recognized as a circle despite the missing portion.

- **Connectedness**: Elements linked by lines or shapes are seen as a unit. Imagine overlapping squares â€“ our brains will likely group them based on the connection.

These principles are used extensively in various fields like design, art, and advertising. By understanding how we group things visually, designers can create layouts that are clear, organized, and engaging.

## How to get noticed as a new streamer?

### Use stream tags to its full potential

The most common way to get noticed is if you set a "coworking" tag into your stream tags. Other variations include "study" and "studywithme". The community has been struggling to discover new streamers through this method due to the variety of "coworking" tags, hence it has been suggested to Twitch that the <a href="https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/310210-discover/suggestions/46004791-coworking" target="_blank" class="underline font-bold hover:text-blue-400">Coworking and Study category</a> should be built into Twitch's list of categories. Please leave a vote to support this suggestion!

### Post to other social media such as YouTube or Instagram

Twitch's discovery system doesn't cater towards those with low viewer count. YouTube, Instagram and other social medias have better discovery systems that allow users to better understand who you are.

Short videos are generally recommended, as it allows users to get a glimpse of who you are.

### Use stream layouts that make your stream stand out

On Twitch, people would go through the browse section with a frame of your stream as the thumbnail. If you want to increase the chances of people taking a look at your stream.

### Disable pre-roll advertisements

After hitting affiliate, your streams will have advertisements. If you disable mid-roll ads, pre-roll ads will be given to your viewers when they hop on your stream.

It is recommended to add Ads Manager to your OBS deck:

`https://dashboard.twitch.tv/popout/u/{{channel}}/stream-manager/streamer-ads-manager-panel`

With the OBS deck, you can manually control when the advertisements start and be notified when the stream advertisement is in progress.

## To mute or not to mute?

Most streamers mute themselves during the work sessions because it makes it easier for the viewers to focus. However it's also possible to leave the mic on for keyboard asmr and general "office noise" which many people enjoy - ask your community what they prefer!

## Should I leave chat opened while working?

Many new coworking streamers often worry about neglecting chat. It's a tough balancing act! On one hand, you want to engage with your community. But on the other hand, you need to focus on your work. After all, that's the whole point of streaming while coworking! So, try not to feel guilty about not always responding to new people immediately. It's actually quite helpful to have mods who can handle the chat interactions for you. And hey, don't forget that you can always have a nice chat with them during your break time!

Having commands such as "!muted" or "!speak" can come in handy. It lets newcomers know that you're currently focused and will catch up with them later. Trust me, as time goes by, you'll attract viewers who are also there to work, so the pressure to chat constantly during work hours will naturally ease up. So hang in there!

## Fixed schedule

It is often recommended that streamers in general stick to a regular schedule because it allows your community to know when to join your channel. While it's definitely beneficial, it's not a requirement and it's totally fine to be flexible with your streams. If you do have irregular stream times, you might want to think about posting on social media to let your followers know you're live.

## Social media

Speaking of social media, it's a great way to let your followers know when you're live! You can also use it to post about your upcoming streams, share your work, and interact with your community. It's a good idea to have a Discord server for your community as well. It's a great way to keep in touch with your viewers and get to know them better!

## Chat commands for coworking streams

Chat commands are very useful since you won't be chatting much during the work timer. Some common chat commands you may see include ones that introduce your stream, provide a brief introduction to the pomodoro method (if you use it), or a muted command that may explain why you may be muted (e.g: !welcome !timer !pomo !muted). You may also like to add a command to tell your viewers what you're working on that day (!today !work !study) - this adds a nice personal touch and you can use it to encourage other's to talk about what they're working on too.

## How to listen to music without getting VOD muted?

If you're streaming on Twitch using OBS, you can easily avoid getting your VODs muted by separating audio tracks into VOD audio tracks and stream audio tracks. This way, you can listen to music on your stream without worrying about getting muted. Here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/0Lj5rkqSp48/" target="_blank" class="underline hover:text-blue-400">video</a> that explains how to do it! (NO VOICEMEETER REQUIRED)

## Emotes

### Channel emotes

When you reach the Twitch Affiliate goal, you can add emotes to your channel for subscribers to use! However, Follower emotes are only available if you have <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/emote-guidelines?language=en_US#instantupload" target="_blank" class="underline hover:text-blue-400">Instant Upload Privilege</a>!

### Emote extensions

Don't understand when your chat says in 'KEKW'? It's a common third party Twitch emote! You can add extensions to your channel to add more emotes for your viewers to use. Some popular ones include BetterTTV, FrankerFaceZ and 7TV.

### Browser Extensions

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://betterttv.com/" target="_blank" class="underline hover:text-blue-400">Download BetterTTV</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.frankerfacez.com/" target="_blank" class="underline hover:text-blue-400">Download FrankerFaceZ</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://7tv.app/" target="_blank" class="underline hover:text-blue-400">Download 7TV</a></li>
</ul>

You won't run into any issues using all three extensions at once!

Only want to use one extension? <a href="https://www.frankerfacez.com/" target="_blank" class="underline hover:text-blue-400">FrankerFaceZ</a> is probably the best one to go for! It is stable, has special addons through the extension itself for BTTV and 7TV emotes, and has the best customization for twitch as a site!

## Other tips

-   Don't promote yourself in other people's channels without permission. It's rude and will likely get you banned.
-   Don't worry about view count, just focus on your work and the rest will follow.
-   Avoid spending money on your stream setup until you're sure you want to stick with it.
-   Avoid using Display/Screen Capture where you may accidentally leak personal information. It is recommended to keep the Display Capture window small enough or to blur it, so that the text content is not readable.
-   Consider using Application Capture Audio instead of Desktop Audio. This will prevent your viewers from hearing your notifications.

## To mute or not to mute?

Most streamers mute themselves during the work sessions because it makes it easier for the viewers to focus. However it's also possible to leave the mic on for keyboard asmr and general "office noise" which many people enjoy - ask your community what they prefer!

## Should I leave chat opened while working?

Many new coworking streamers often worry about neglecting chat. It's a tough balancing act! On one hand, you want to engage with your community. But on the other hand, you need to focus on your work. After all, that's the whole point of streaming while coworking! So, try not to feel guilty about not always responding to new people immediately. It's actually quite helpful to have mods who can handle the chat interactions for you. And hey, don't forget that you can always have a nice chat with them during your break time!

Having commands such as "!muted" or "!speak" can come in handy. It lets newcomers know that you're currently focused and will catch up with them later. Trust me, as time goes by, you'll attract viewers who are also there to work, so the pressure to chat constantly during work hours will naturally ease up. So hang in there!

## Fixed schedule

It is often recommended that streamers in general stick to a regular schedule because it allows your community to know when to join your channel. While it's definitely beneficial, it's not a requirement and it's totally fine to be flexible with your streams. If you do have irregular stream times, you might want to think about posting on social media to let your followers know you're live.

## Social media

Speaking of social media, it's a great way to let your followers know when you're live! You can also use it to post about your upcoming streams, share your work, and interact with your community. It's a good idea to have a Discord server for your community as well. It's a great way to keep in touch with your viewers and get to know them better!

## Chat commands for coworking streams

Chat commands are very useful since you won't be chatting much during the work timer. Some common chat commands you may see include ones that introduce your stream, provide a brief introduction to the pomodoro method (if you use it), or a muted command that may explain why you may be muted (e.g: !welcome !timer !pomo !muted). You may also like to add a command to tell your viewers what you're working on that day (!today !work !study) - this adds a nice personal touch and you can use it to encourage other's to talk about what they're working on too.

# Groups

I recommend the following communities to join! They provide a great way to connect with other streamers and viewers!

The Coworking Crew is a group of co-working streamers who aim to create supportive and motivational live streams for people who are working or studying at home. As a group we help each other out, collaborate on stream, and ultimately find new friends.

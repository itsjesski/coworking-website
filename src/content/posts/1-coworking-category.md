## How it started

On 27th February 2024, a "Coworking" category appeared on Twitch. However, this is not an official category from Twitch, rather a "small, distraction game" as listed in IGDB (Internet Game Database), the database Twitch uses to provide gaming categories. 

As a result, a significant number of coworking and study streamers use this category as a way to improve their discoverability since it is less saturated compared to the "Just Chatting" category.

As of writing, the intention behind publishing the "Coworking" category still remains unclear.

## Productivity streamers started using it

The coworking & study community has been [petitioning for a Coworking and Study category](https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/310210-discover/suggestions/46004791-coworking) since late 2022, stating that it would improve discoverability for productivity streamers.

Once this "Coworking" category came out, coworking and study streamers became aware of it and started using it as a makeshift category to improve discoverability of their streams. It also clarifies that it's a productivity stream rather than a regular Just Chatting stream (from a following feed, as an example).

While some of these streamers may be aware that it's a "game category", quite a number of them are not.

## Why many streamers decided against using it

Many experienced coworking streamers have shown disinterest with the new "Coworking" category because it is a game and has little viewers compared to Just Chatting. Since it has a much smaller audience compared to Just Chatting, it may lead to reduced chances of being discovered by potential viewers.

A member of the coworking community said:

> (Basically, because) I'm trying to hit partner, and if I use a non-Just Chatting category right now, I'd only be limiting my exposure to new viewers

The official Coworking Crew team has also made a statement regarding this topic:

> As a Coworking Crew Team, we believe it might affect individual streamers' discoverability and could give Twitch the wrong idea about our satisfaction with not having an officially endorsed category. 

There are other discussions about the cons of using the "Coworking" category:

- Low chance of being in the "Reading, Studying and Coworking" collection on the front page
- Subjected to be in violation of Twitch TOS about "miscategorizing" since you're not playing the game.
- Causing a significant divide in algorithm from those productivity streamers using "Just Chatting" as their category
- May reduce likelihood of Twitch actually implementing an official Coworking category, due to concerns of conflicts in the algorithm (Twitch may think: A lot of people are streaming "coworking", implementing a "coworking & study" category will just mess things up)

### But "I'm Only Sleeping" streamers are misusing the game category

The coworking community is more passionate and dedicated to have their own space on the platform, compared to "I'm Only Sleeping" streamers who don't bother about having an official "sleeping" category.

In the end, misusing the game category is still against Twitch's Terms of Service and doing so may lead to warnings, suspensions or a permanent strike on your channel.

## How does the new category affect the Twitch algorithm?

As mentioned several times, the "coworking" category is a game. This means that Twitch's algorithm will:

- Register streamers in that category as "playing a game"
- Users who watch "Coworking" for a long period of time as avid gaming stream viewers

As a result, Twitch's recommendation algorithm may:
- Recommend "Coworking" category streamers to avid gaming viewers
- Recommend gaming streams to productivity viewers

Although Twitch's recommendation algorithm remain a mystery to the general public, companies that use data analytics tend to follow similar patterns.

### Pros of using "Coworking" category:

1. Less competition than "Just Chatting".

2. More discoverability from people searching by the category.

### Cons of using "Coworking" category:

2. (Speculation) Users who watch the "Coworking" category may be misunderstood by the algorithm, leading to more game recommendations.

3. (Speculation) Streamers using the "Coworking" category may have a significant divide from those who are using the "Just Chatting" category by the Twitch algorithm (in terms of user recommendations).

4. You're less likely to be on the "Reading, Studying, and Coworking" list on the front page.

5. Subjected to be in violation of Twitch TOS about "miscategorizing" since you're not playing the game.

## Conclusion

The purpose of this post is not to persuade people to "pick a side", rather it is meant to inform and show the bigger picture of this "Coworking" category. Please do not pressure nor target any streamers regarding this topic, and don't forget to [VOTE for an official Coworking and Study category](https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/310210-discover/suggestions/46004791-coworking).
